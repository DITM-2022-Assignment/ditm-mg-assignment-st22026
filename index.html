       <p>Online security is something most of us use on a daily basis sometimes we dont even know we are using it! It is commonly used by websites to keep your personal information as safe as possible. Some websites apply their security by asking for your email address and other contact details which are unique to you. Most websites will have a disclaimer explaining exactly how the information you provide will be used and/or distributed. This should be reviewed carefully to ensure you are fully aware of your digital footprint and how your personal data is being stored and used.</p>

          <p>Privacy used to be considered a concept generally respected in many countries with a few changes to rules and regulations here and there often made only in the name of the common good.<br><br> Everything from our web browsing to mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) products installed in our homes has the potential to erode our privacy and personal security, and you cannot depend on vendors or ever-changing surveillance rules to keep them intact.<br><br>
            Having "nothing to hide" doesn't cut it anymore. We must all do whatever we can to safeguard our personal privacy not only from agencies and companies but also from each other.<br><br>Taking the steps outlined below can not only give you some sanctuary from spreading surveillance tactics but also help keep you safe from cyberattackers, scam artists, and a new, emerging issue: technological stalking.</p>
